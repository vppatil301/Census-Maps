# Defining a new dataframe: Southwest Counties
# First we define a new dataframe.  As we are using counties from Southwest, we call it SouthwestCT
# You should notice some other differences in the code
# The geography was changed from "county" to "tract" because we want the smaller spatial unit
# variables, Survey, Year, Output stay the same (it will bring back same variables from same year in the same way)
# The state="" is new and here you could define the state.  We want the Detriot MSA so its only "MI", but if you wanted to add more, you could with state=c("MI", "OH", ...)
# The county= argument is also new.  here you can define the specific counties you would want to pull.  the c("county1name", "county2name", etc) comes from the MSA counties for 
SouthwestCT<-get_acs(geography = "tract",  #Defining the spatial scale
                      variables = Variables, #grabbing the variables we defined previously
                      survey = "acs5",      # survey we are pulling is the ACS 5 year estimates
                      year = 2020,   # End year for the 5 year estimates- 2016-2020
                      output = "wide", # data format wide (cross sectional)
                      state="MI", # Define which State you want to pull data from
                      county= c("Berrien","Branch", "Cass", "Calhoun", "Kalamazoo", "St. Joseph", "Van Buren"), # Defining the counties in the state that the data will come from
                      geometry=T) # Pulls the spatial data information with it.


# First 10 records/observations return
head(SouthwestCT)

# summary() provides an overview of the data
summary(SouthwestCT)

view(SouthwestCT)

# Lets clean up this data a little bit before we go too far
# Here we are just pulling out the columns we care about using the indexing dataframe[,c("column name","etc")]
Southwest<-SouthwestCT[,c("GEOID", "NAME", "MHIE", "MHVE", "TotalpopE", "geometry")]
# Easy renaming of the variables
names(Southwest)[names(Southwest) =="MHIE"]<-"MHI"
names(Southwest)[names(Southwest) =="MHVE"]<-"MHV"
names(Southwest)[names(Southwest) =="TotalpopE"]<-"Totalpop"


### Setting up the color palettes
SpalMHI<-colorQuantile(palette = "magma", domain=Southwest$MHI, n=10)
SpalMHV<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdYlGn", domain=Southwest$MHV, n=10)
Spalpop<-colorQuantile(palette = "BrBG", domain=Southwest$Totalpop, n=10)
